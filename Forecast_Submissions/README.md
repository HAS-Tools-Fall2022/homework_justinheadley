# Grading
- Forecast Sept 15: (2/3) Code runs, andd produces predictions, but you didn't use `numpy` anywhere. Also, this doesn't affect the grade, but the data was daily so your code doesn't quite do what your comments say. If you'd like to see how to work out the weekly declines stop by office hours!
